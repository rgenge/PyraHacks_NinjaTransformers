This program does ocr on your screen and then runs what it sees through a LLM model giving you constructive criticism on the code you are looking at and explains what it is doing, it does this with its tkinter UI and also uses speech to talk to you about what it think. The purpose of this program is to aid developers in understanding the code they are looking at and allow the AI models to view errors in the terminal and make correction suggestions.
